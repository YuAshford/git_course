What is the difference between Visual Studio Code and Visual Studio IDE?#
Visual Studio Code is a streamlined code editor with support for development operations like debugging, task running, and version control.

Which OSs are supported?#
VS Code runs on macOS, Linux, and Windows. See the Requirements documentation for the supported versions. You can find more platform specific details in the Setup overview.

Is VS Code free?#
Yes, VS Code is free for private or commercial use. See the product license for details.
